# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! A few guidelines to make contributions smooth.

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your change.
- Keep changes small and focus on one issue per PR.
- Ensure the project builds and tests pass locally before opening a pull request.
  - Build: cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
  - Build: cmake --build build --parallel
  - Test: ./build/build/tests.exe (on Windows: .\build\build\tests.exe)
- Prefer clear, well-documented code. Inline comments are welcome for non-obvious behavior.
- Follow the existing code style (C, C99); avoid large formatting changes in the same patch.
- When adding features, include or update tests under `tests/` where appropriate.
- For bug reports, include steps to reproduce and platform/compiler details.

Maintainers will review pull requests and provide feedback. Thanks!
